## Motivation

This started out as an XTS library, then became something else, a huge crawling repo with too much stuff doing too many things. So it's been broken up into numerous libraries which will break out the elements into modules which align in function and intent. Basically the motivation is to have a clue whats going on :-) 

## The Goal

The Goal of this repo is to define a set of base behaviour of any module created for PLC use. The objects within this library will force a particular behaviour for handling cyclic behaviour, task calls and initialisation. All objects used in a PLC program will be built on these basic building blocks.
